A small app to examine Android on Chromebooks.



Full Screen:

Behaves differently on Android versions on Chromebooks based on setting
the Chromebook "shelf" (bottom bar w/ app icons).

On Android 9 app can always go into full screen mode.

On Android 11 app cannot go into full screen mode if the shelf is set
t0 "always show"

On tablets, works as expected - can go into full screen mode.
